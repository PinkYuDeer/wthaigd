What the hell am I gonna do (Minecraft Mod)

中文版介绍在这里：[README-zh_CN.md](./README-zh_CN.md)

This mod is developed for Minecraft 1.7.10 GTNH 2.7.x environment (future adaptations for vanilla and higher versions may be considered).

Gantt Chart Mod (maybe)

This is the author's first mod, created primarily as a learning project in development; therefore, it may appear somewhat rough around the edges. However, I am committed to actively learning and improving.

* Despite its imperfections, I welcome guidance from experienced developers or creative individuals to help elevate my skills and this mod to a competent or even excellent level.

Please feel free to open multiple issues to report bugs, suggestions, modifications, etc.

If you wish to submit a pull request (PR), please provide an explanation; while I have programming experience, I lack experience in mod development.
